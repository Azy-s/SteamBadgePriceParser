# Steam Badge Price Parser

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Windows application that helps analyze current Steam badge prices in your local currency through direct interaction with the Steam Marketplace.

## üöÄ Why is this needed?

The [SteamCardExchange](https://www.steamcardexchange.net/) service displays badge prices only in US dollars (USD), but the actual cost in other currencies (e.g., RUB, EUR, UAH) can vary significantly due to:
- Currency exchange rate fluctuations
- Steam regional pricing
- Market demand

**Example:** Two badges priced at $0.30 on SteamCardExchange may cost the following on the Steam Marketplace:
- 18 ‚ÇΩ ($0.18)
- 38 ‚ÇΩ ($0.38)

This application parses prices **directly through your Steam account**, taking into account your local currency for accurate calculations.

## üîí Security

**Important:** The application **does not interact with your Steam account** beyond browser-based authorization. It does not have access to your personal data, inventory, wallet, or other account-specific information.  
- Authorization occurs through the standard Steam browser interface.
- The application does not save logins, passwords, or cookies.
- The entire parsing process occurs in the browser, and the program only processes publicly available data from the Steam Marketplace.
- For additional security, you can use a blank account with your desired currency set.
- All parser functions are located in the "Parser.cs" file.
